# MK.PowerShell.Flow

Flow is to streamline [PowerShell](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell) development by having an idea created and then published to the world in minutes without compromising quality.

You may have a PowerShell idea and gone thru the process of preparing this idea into a module so that it's available to be shared. And in doing so you might of created tests, documentation and published it to a repository such as [PowerShell Gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/). And perhaps after publishing you may have releaized that the version number should of been changed, along with the README file. This process can be cumbersome especially when completing other objectives. Flow attempts to remove this hinderance for you.

Inspired by [Convention over configuration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_over_configuration) strategy and [Don't repeat yourself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself), Flow expects some structure in order to be used.  Currently that structure can be generated by using [`Install-Template`](https://github.com/marckassay/MK.PowerShell.Flow/blob/0.0.1/docs/Install-Template.md) command by using its 'NewModuleProject' and 'NewScript' templates.

## The Development Flow

- Create
- Develop and Test
- Document
- Publish

### Create

First step is to scaffold files from a [Plaster](https://github.com/PowerShell/Plaster) template. Flow currently has 2 templates available when installed; 'NewModuleProject' and 'NewScript' (for information on templates, visit: [Creating a Plaster Manifest](https://github.com/PowerShell/Plaster/blob/master/docs/en-US/about_Plaster_CreatingAManifest.help.md)). Flow's [`Install-Template`](https://github.com/marckassay/MK.PowerShell.Flow/blob/0.0.1/docs/Install-Template.md) command is to be used to install Plaster templates. The 'NewModuleProject' template creates a new PowerShell module that includes the *convention* that Flow expects in a module.  The 'DestinationPath' parameter for this template, doesn't have to be in a PowerShell module path (`$Env:PSModulePath`) for it to be imported. Flow will append the PowerShell profile with an `Import-Module` statement.

After that template is installed (scaffold), you probably want to add your first command to the module. The 'NewScript' template does this.

For an example, the following:

```powershell
PS C:\Users\Alice\projects> Install-Template -TemplateName NewModuleProject -DestinationPath . -ModuleName AcmeTasks -Author Alice
Destination path: C:\Users\Alice\projects
Flow is scaffolding your PowerShell template...

   Create AcmeTasks\src\
   Create AcmeTasks\test\
   Create AcmeTasks\resources\
   Create AcmeTasks\README.md
   Create AcmeTasks\LICENSE
   Create AcmeTasks\AcmeTasks.psm1
   Create AcmeTasks\AcmeTasks.psd1

Scaffolding is completed.
```

Now commands can be added to this module. To do so, the location needs to be changed to the project's root folder and then install 'NewScript' template:

```powershell
PS C:\Users\Alice\projects\AcmeTasks> Install-Template -TemplateName NewScript -ScriptCongruentPath io/file -ScriptName Compress-Data

Destination path: C:\Users\Alice\projects\AcmeTasks
Flow is scaffolding your PowerShell template...

   Create src\io\file\Compress-Data.ps1
   Create test\io\file\Compress-Data.Tests.ps1

Scaffolding is completed.
```

Above the first command is scaffold, 'Compress-Data'. You may have made the conclusion already that the value of 'ScriptCongruentPath' is the sub-path to the new command file in 'src' and 'test' folder. In an addition to what you may have already determined that has been done by executing these two commands, the root module (AcmeTasks.psm1) has been prefixed with the following:

```powershell
using module .\src\io\file\Compress-Data.ps1
```

And the module manifest (AcmeTasks.psd1) file has its 'FunctionsToExport' key updated to:

```powershell
FunctionsToExport = @(
        'Compress-Data'
    )
```

### Develop and Test

With scaffolding in place, you can develop source file and test against it using [Pester](https://github.com/pester/Pester) (In this step I find TDD practices are beneficial especially the way Pester integrates with [VSCode](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode) and using CLI with PowerShell).  The source or test file will have code that will not be needed for your needs, you can remove what is not needed.

When you believe you are ready to continue to the next step (Document), call [`Invoke-TestSuiteRunner`](https://github.com/marckassay/MK.PowerShell.Flow/blob/0.0.1/docs/Invoke-TestSuiteRunner.md) to ensure that all test cases that are expected to pass do indeed pass. Although for this example, there is only one test file so the results will be the same as if you tested that file explictly. This command will be beneifical when more tests are added to this module.

```powershell
PS C:\Users\Alice\projects\AcmeTasks> Invoke-TestSuiteRunner
```

Since `Invoke-TestSuiteRunner` has been executed without an argument, the location of PowerShell must be in the 'AcmeTasks' folder. Alternatively Invoke-TestSuiteRunner can be called with a path value to a module via `Path` parameter, or name value to a module via `Name`. The `Name` parameter has a "validate set" constraint which the elements of that set are retrieved from a `Get-Module` call.

When using Git with GitHub, if your Git branch is named with a valid Semantic Version value, this value will be transposed to the `ModuleVersion` key in the manifest file automatically.  Only simple variants (regex: \d.\d.\d) of Semantic Version will work otherwise PowerShell will not be able to import the module. At this step or the next ('Document') you may manually change the module version using [`Update-SemVer`](https://github.com/marckassay/MK.PowerShell.Flow/blob/0.0.1/docs/Update-SemVer.md).

### Document

When development passes testing, generate documentation files powered by [platyPS](https://github.com/PowerShell/platyPS). Using the following command:

```powershell
PS C:\Users\Alice\projects\AcmeTasks> Build-Documentation
```

Used in its most simplest form, calling [Build-Documentation](https://github.com/marckassay/MK.PowerShell.Flow/blob/0.0.1/docs/Build-Documentation.md) with no parameters is intended to be called inside the root directory of a PowerShell module. And when executed, it will call platyPS commands that will generate or update markdown files for all commands listed in the manifest's `FunctionsToExport` key. It will also execute Flow code that will update a README.md file in the root directory. 

This file will have an API section added or updated, with each exported command's markdown link and synopsis of the command. Such an example can be seen on this very file your are reading.  See the API section of this file below.

### Publish

As mentioned above in the Create section, your module doesn't have to reside in a `$Env:PSModulePath`.  And if it doesn't you can publish your module without moving it into one of the path(s) of `$Env:PSModulePath` (which is required by the internal publish command [`Publish-Module`]()).  Flow will copy your module into one of these paths and will delete it after publishing.

```powershell
PS C:\Users\Alice\projects\AcmeTasks> Publish-ModuleToNuGetGallery
```

To explain further on the reason for this command, by giving an example, I currently have individual PowerShell modules listed in my PowerShell profile. These modules that are listed point to my development directory where they reside on my file system. So when I had to publish a module prior to this command, I would have to copy the folder to a PowerShell module directory. A cumbersome process indeed, so this command has been created to speed up that process. In an addition Flow can store your API key on your file system using [`Set-MKPowerShellSetting`](https://github.com/marckassay/MK.PowerShell.Flow/blob/0.0.1/docs/Set-MKPowerShellSetting.md) which will be retrieved automatically when [`Publish-ModuleToNuGetGallery`](https://github.com/marckassay/MK.PowerShell.Flow/blob/0.0.1/docs/Publish-ModuleToNuGetGallery.md) is called if its `NuGetApiKey` parameter value is not set. Also remember when Flow creates a module manifest file, it will set the Prerelease key to '-alpha' so that when published, it is still accessble to anyone searching for modules with or without prerelease status.

## Flow Config File

When Flow is installed and ran for the first time, it will place a copy of its config file in the ApplicationData folder. Use [`Get-MKPowerShellSetting`](https://github.com/marckassay/MK.PowerShell.Flow/blob/0.0.1/docs/Get-MKPowerShellSetting.md) and [`Set-MKPowerShellSetting`](https://github.com/marckassay/MK.PowerShell.Flow/blob/0.0.1/docs/Set-MKPowerShellSetting.md) accordingly.  All values below are default values.

```json
"NuGetApiKey": "",
```

Store your API key that was issued from [PowerShell Gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/). When [`Publish-ModuleToNuGetGallery`](https://github.com/marckassay/MK.PowerShell.Flow/blob/0.0.1/docs/Publish-ModuleToNuGetGallery.md) is called this value will be retrieved.


```json
"TurnOnAutoUpdateSemVer": "true",
```

Updates manifest's `ModuleVersion` key when using some of Flow commands. So if you GitHub branch name has simple Semantic Version value, it will be transposed to this manifest key.

## Q&A

### What conformity does Flow expect in your module?

Although it's still early in development, I can only recall the following conditions that may have issues:

+ URLs are parsed and validated with the expectation of them structured the way GitHub has them.

+ Module folder, manifest and root module are expected to all have the same the name.

+ The 'src', 'test' and 'docs' folders inside the module folder are where the source, test and document files respectively are expected to reside.

+ Git development branches are expected to be in SemVer format (currently, simple variant only must be used (regex: \d\.\d\.\d)) in order for auto update version to work.

### What other advantages does Flow give me?

+ Updates URLs in documentation files to prevent users loading a webpage that is not the version of module they have.

+ Automatically change ModuleVersion number to Git branch name only if its a simplied (regex: \d.\d.\d) SemVer.

+ Automatically imports script files (.ps1) into the root module and exports the function(s) of those files in the module's manifest.

### What other features are planned to be in Flow?

+ GitHub repository creation at the same time when `Install-Template` is called to scaffold a new module.

+ More preferences in config file such as, license type, expected module sub folders ('src', 'test', 'docs'), editor to launch.
